<h2>Overview</h2>
Your challenge is to build out this pricing component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

<h3>What I Learnt</h3>
  <p>
    This was a fairly simple project for me to replicate, I didn't learn much; however, I tried to stick to a more DRY code than usual.
    I had also split the css code into multiple modules for better readability.
  </p>
<h3>Continued Development</h3>
  <p>
    I would like to go back over this and change the colors to match closer to the original design, other than this... I'm am happy with the outcome of this project.
